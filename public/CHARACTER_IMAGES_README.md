# Character Images Setup

To complete the character-based chat interface, please add your character images:

## Required Images

1. **character1.jpg** - For the first maid character (Sakura)
   - Save the first maid image (with black and white dress) as `character1.jpg`
   - Place it in the `public` folder

2. **character2.jpg** - For the second maid character (Yuki)
   - Save the second maid image (with elegant dress) as `character2.jpg`
   - Place it in the `public` folder

## How to Add Images

1. Save the two images you provided as:
   - `character1.jpg` (first image)
   - `character2.jpg` (second image)

2. Place both files in this `public` folder

3. The app will automatically load them as backgrounds for each character

## Image Guidelines

- Recommended size: At least 800x1200 pixels
- Format: JPG or PNG
- The images will be displayed as backgrounds with a semi-transparent overlay
- Character faces will be prominently visible while maintaining text readability

## Current Status

The app is fully configured to use these images. Once you add them to the public folder, restart the development server to see the characters with their backgrounds!
